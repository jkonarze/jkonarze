### Hi there! 👋

I'm **Jan**, and I’ve been passionate about coding ever since I started in college back in 2008. 🧑‍💻 I love solving puzzles and building things (just like with LEGO!), which makes software engineering a perfect fit for me.

I’m a dual citizen 🇺🇸🇪🇺, so I’m authorized to work in both the USA and the EU.

💬 **Ask me about**:
- Microservices
- Event-driven designs
- Golang
- Google Cloud Platform (especially App Engine—seriously, it’s so good! Why don’t more people use it?)

📫 **How to reach me**: Feel free to send me an email or drop me a [LinkedIn message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-konarzewski-54a75648/).

⚡ **Fun fact**: I’m all about hands-on experience. I love traveling 🌍 and living in different places to form my own opinions. Also, as a former collegiate athlete 🏊‍♂️, I believe staying active is key to both physical and mental well-being.
